## Configure your JAVA_HOME environment variable

To ensure youâ€™ll be working with the correct version of JVM is necessary to configure and environment variable which will be called ```JAVA_HOME```.

1. We need to find the installation folder of our JDK, to achieve it we will need to open a new terminal and execute the command ```open /Library/Java``` which is the default installation folder for the JVM.

    At this point you must be watching the following folder:
   ![JDK_Default_Folder.png](./src/JDK_Default_Folder.png)

2. We need to navigate into the folder till we find the java bin folder
   ![JDK_Bin_folder.png](./src/JDK_Bin_folder.png)

3. Do a right click on ```Home folder``` and select the option ```new terminal at folder```

4. At the terminal execute the command ```pwd``` it will show the installation path of our JVM.

5. Open your [source file for environment variables](TerminalResourceFile.md) and add the following lines (change the path to the one shown on step 4):
   ```
   export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.14.jdk/Contents/Home"
   export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
   ```
6. Close all terminal which are currently running.
7. Open a new terminal and execute the command ```java --version``` , the response must show the java version you just installed.
   e.g.
   ```
   java 11.0.14 2022-01-18 LTS
   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.14+8-LTS-263)
   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.14+8-LTS-263, mixed mode)
